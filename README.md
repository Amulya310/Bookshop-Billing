# Bookshop-Billing
This is an online portal to buy stationery from Hiteshi Bookshop (NITH).
THE SOLE INTENTION BEHIND THE CONSIDERATION OF THIS PROJECT IS TO GENERATE A PORTAL FOR OUR COLLEGE STATIONERY SHOP THAT WOULD BASICALLY RECORD ORDERS FROM THE BUYERS(STUDENTS) AND GENERATE A BILL FOR THE SAME. 
THE PORTAL IS DESIGNED TO DIGITALIZE OUR COLLEGE STATIONERY FOR THE EASE OF BOTH, SELLER AND THE BUYER. THIS PROJECT IS DEVELOPED USING C++ AND MAJOR CONCEPTS OF OOPS(INHERITANCE +STL). 
PROBLEMS FACED DURING MANUAL PURCHASE:
->We have always experienced big hassles and rush in the stationery.
->Buying items in the stationery has always been time consuming.
->Buying from the stationery shop has been really inconvenient for the girls due to its location.
->There is no proper record of the bills.
->Social distancing has become an important thing to practise these days and it is difficult to maintain it in college due to the strength of students.
THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT IS TO OVERCOME ALL THE DRAWBACKS OF MANUAL  PURCHASING OF STATIONERY ITEMS IN OUR COLLEGE.*/
